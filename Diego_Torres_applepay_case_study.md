It went public in 1980, to instant financial success.
in 2013 service was announced at Apple's iPhone 6 event on September 9, 2014.   
At its announcement, Apple CEO Tim Cook described the magnetic stripe card payment process as broken for its reliance on plastic cards'      
"outdated and vulnerable magnetic interface", "exposed numbers", and insecure "security codes".    
The iOS 8.1 software update accompanying the service's launch activated Apple Pay on compatible devices.

* ## Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space?
Today, Apple is securing its place as a significant player in the fintech space with Apple Card.  
The iPhone offers the Apple’s Wallet app, Apple Pay, and Apple Pay Cash, the Apple credit card is the next logical step.  
Apple has partnered with US bank Goldman Sachs to improve the credit card experience by offering a healthier approach to spending.   
They’re offering a more transparent list of transactions, organized in an easy to read format, with a more flexible way of   
making payments on outstanding balances.

* ## What are their strengths and weaknesses?

The Closed Ecosystem
Many of Apple’s loyal customers see the company’s tightly controlled software and services as a major strength of the company,   
as it allows Apple to control all aspects of the devices it produces.  
Overall, however, this puts an additional burden on Apple’s development cycle as software, security, and many other details become an in-house responsibility.  
On the other hand  Payment
After shoppers have their credit card stored on the iPhone, they only need to keep the phone near an NFC scanner,  
use the iPhone’s Touch ID to accept the purchase using their fingerprint,  
and the payment is processed within a few seconds.
The approach is easier than the conventional swiping procedure for credit cards,  
which normally involves: swiping a card and then choosing debit or credit, providing a different id,   
and affixing a signature.

* ## Where do they expect to be in the future?   
Mobile wallets are catching up with cash, even in the US.    
In 2020, 10% of spending at points of sale (cash tills) made use of a digital or mobile wallet such as Apple Pay.    
In comparison, 11.9% of such transactions took place in cash, so the use of contactless mobile payments is clearly catching up.   
(In Canada, cash was used for just 5.4% of transactions.)
These are global trends. Worldwide use of cash has dropped 42% since 2019.   
Cash will soon be the least used traditional payment method, the report said.  
By 2025, Apple Pay will account for 10% of global card transactions, according to research firm Bernstein as reported by Quartz on Tuesday.    
The mobile payment feature currently accounts for about 5% of credit card transactions, according to the report.
