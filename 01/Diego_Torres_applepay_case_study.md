* ## Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space?
Today, Apple is securing its place as a significant player in the fintech space with Apple Card.  
The iPhone offers the Apple’s Wallet app, Apple Pay, and Apple Pay Cash, the Apple credit card is the next logical step.  
Apple has partnered with US bank Goldman Sachs to improve the credit card experience by offering a healthier approach to spending.   
They’re offering a more transparent list of transactions, organized in an easy to read format, with a more flexible way of   
making payments on outstanding balances.

* ## What are their strengths and weaknesses?

The Closed Ecosystem
Many of Apple’s loyal customers see the company’s tightly controlled software and services as a major strength of the company,   
as it allows Apple to control all aspects of the devices it produces.  
Overall, however, this puts an additional burden on Apple’s development cycle as software, security, and many other details become an in-house responsibility.  
On the other hand  Payment
After shoppers have their credit card stored on the iPhone, they only need to keep the phone near an NFC scanner,  
use the iPhone’s Touch ID to accept the purchase using their fingerprint,  
and the payment is processed within a few seconds.
The approach is easier than the conventional swiping procedure for credit cards,  
which normally involves: swiping a card and then choosing debit or credit, providing a different id,   
and affixing a signature.
